## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
   chmod +x pip.sh
   ./pip.sh -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is recommended that you use a virtual environment. You can set one up as follows:

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pip.sh
   ./pip.sh -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   The project contains Jupyter notebooks that provide a step-by-step guide for data analysis, model building, and evaluation. You can launch the Jupyter environment by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Navigate to the relevant notebook files to explore the data, build machine learning models, and visualize the results.

### Uploading to git hub
   ```bash
      chmod +x git-commit-push.sh
      ./git-commit-push.sh comment
   ```
